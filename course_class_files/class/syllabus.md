## Course Objectives:

This course aims to: 

1.	To provide the concepts of sampling and sampling distributions.
2.	To provide the applications of point estimation, confidence interval and hypothesis testing .
3.	To provide the applications of regression analysis and analysis of variance.

We will closely follow the weekly schedule given below.
However, weekly class schedules are subject to change depending on the progress we make as a class.

Week 1. Sampling from Normal Distribution. 

Week 2. Estimation: The likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimators.

Week 3. Properties of estimators: Mean-square-error, unbiasedness, consistency. 

Week 4. Fisher information and efficient estimators.  

Week 5. Asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators.

Week 6. Confidence intervals: (1-$\alpha$) confidence intervals and Pivotal quantities.

Week 7. Testing statistical hypothesis and test statistics.

Week 8. Optimal Tests: Randomized tests.

Week 9. Powerful tests: power function, Simple hypothesis, Neyman-Pearson Theorem.

Week 10. Likelihood Ratio tests. Sufficient Statistics.

Week 11. ITU Spring Break

Week 12. One-sample, Two-sample and paired tests.

Week 13. Regression and correlation.

```{note}
* `Student studies, namely, homework and exam papers which are not written well, does not follow a proper mathematical writing language, and are hard to review, will get "0" credit for that question.`
* `Please see an example for **a good homework** on Ninova.`

## Make-Up Exam Policy

<p align="justify"> The students who miss either midterm exam or final exam due to a health problem
can take a make-up exam as long as they have a valid medical report taken on the exam day. The medical report should be handed in immediately (within two days of its expiration). <p>

2. Start off your e-mail with a proper greeting, introduce yourself (give your name), then state your problem as short as possible.
3. Finally, use a proper closing and then finish your e-mail with your first name and so on.

Feel free to send me e-mails. But be sure you that give me enough time to get back to you. 

```{note}
* `In the past, I have had pretty much tolerance for e-mail messages sent after business hours and at weekends. But, now, due to pandemic, I should say that I may not appreciate these e-mails anymore.`
* `Lastly, e-mails asking for grade grubbing at the end of the semester are not welcomed.`
